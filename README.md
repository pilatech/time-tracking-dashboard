## My process

- First created the markup with emphasis on semantics - my approach is 'desktop first' when it comes to marking up my documents even though I do peep into mobile layout here and there.
- Created CSS for mobile version
- Then I jumped into creating JavaScript for interactivity
- I then got back into completing the desktop styles

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
